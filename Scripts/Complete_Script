# Here is the full working script for "Intro to Map Making tutorial,
# using Data from my Ecological measurement field course.
# We will explore 2 ways of vreating maps for the study sites.


# Setting up --

# Set the working directory
setwd("your_filepath")

# Install packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("leaflet")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("OpenStreetMap")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("htmlwidgets")
install.packages("widgetframe")

# Load packages
library(tidyverse) # for easy data manipulation
library(leaflet)   # for map making
library(readr)     # for importing the data set
library(OpenStreetMap) # the second option for creating map
library(knitr)
library(htmlwidgets) # to savethe maps
library(widgetframe) # to save the maps


# ========= Make map with leaflet package ========

# Step 1: load the site coordinates
site_coords <- read_csv("Raw_Data/site_coords.csv")

# View data to check it loaded properly
View(site_coords)
# Looks good!

# Step 2: Use the leaflet() function to create the map
(leafletMap <- leaflet(data = site_coords) %>%   # The '%>%' sign is called  pipe, and runs the line onto the next line without retyping the object!
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircles(lng = ~long,    # Here we are adding circles to mark the study sites.
             lat = ~lat,     # When calling data from the data frame, put '~' 
             radius = 50,
             fillOpacity = 1,
             stroke = FALSE,
             color = 'black',          # Here we are just using black, however other colours can be used!
             label= ~Site_Name) %>%    # The '~' tell it to use the column 'site_Name' from the df to make labels.
  addScaleBar(position = 'bottomleft')) # Adding a scale bar is important for scientific writing!

# Step 3: Check the viewer tab... looks good right? Notice how you can zoom in and out using
# the plus and minus arrows!

# Step 4:Exporting as webpage.
# Because the mouse must hover over the black spot to see the Study Site name,
# then we must export this map as a web page, to allow use to still see the names.

saveWidget(leafletMap, file = "leafletMap_saved.html")

frameWidget(leafletMap, height = 350, width = '95%')


# TRYING TO SAVE A DIFFERENT WAY
saveWidgetframe(leafletMap, file = "leafletMap_widget.html", selfcontained = FALSE, libdir = NULL,
                background = "white", knitrOptions = list())

# This time we are adding blue, slightly opaque cirlces, and the site name appears too!
(blue_dots_map <- leaflet(data = site_coords) %>%   
  addTiles() %>% 
addCircleMarkers(lng = ~long, 
                 lat = ~lat,
                 radius = 8 , color="purple",  
                 fillColor = "blue", 
                 stroke = TRUE, 
                 fillOpacity = 0.5,
                 label= ~Site_Name) %>%   
  addScaleBar(position = 'bottomleft'))

# save output
saveWidget(blue_dots_map, file = "blue_dots_map_saved.html")


# Add markers with site names.
(marker_map_leaflet <- leaflet(data = site_coords) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(label = ~Site_Name,
             labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T)) %>%
  addScaleBar(position='bottomleft'))

# save output
saveWidget(marker_map_leaflet, file = "marker_map_saved.html")

# save, remember you need to include 'Â© OpenStreetMap contributors'
